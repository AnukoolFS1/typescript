// Sometimes you need to store a value in a variable.
// But you don't know its type at the time writing the program.
// And the unknown value may come from third party API or user input.

// In this case, you want to opt-out of the type checking and allow the value to
// to Pass through the compiler time check

// To do so, you use the "any" type.
// The "any" type allows you to assign a value of "any" type to a variable
